# About

This book provides a practical introduction to applying **data mining techniques using R**, focusing on implementing and interpreting key algorithms without complex model tuning.

This book takes a **data mining-oriented perspective**, guiding readers through the basic workflow of data preprocessing, modeling, and result interpretation. It is designed to be approachable for beginners, with clear explanations and example-based demonstrations.

Key features of the book include:

-   Conceptual overviews and practical motivations behind each algorithm
-   A step-by-step analysis process in R: from preprocessing to modeling and evaluation
-   Application of algorithms using default settings, without hyperparameter tuning
-   Example code using real-world datasets
-   Simple interpretation of analysis results

This book is intended for **students, graduate researchers, data analysis beginners, and practitioners**, focusing more on **practical implementation and interpretation** than on theoretical depth or algorithmic comparisons.

By prioritizing understanding the structure of the data and following a consistent analysis workflow, readers will gain the ability to independently apply fundamental data mining techniques using R in real-world settings.
